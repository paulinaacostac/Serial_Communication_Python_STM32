# Serial_Communication_Python_STM32
 Communicate HAL_UART protocol of STM32 card with a Python Script

# STM32 Project
This project was created with STM32 CubeIDE. Made for the STM32F303K8 board. 
Open CubeIDE and import the project
Run the project over the STM board, this should start UART protocol and start communication to the port in your machine.
Check your port ex: tty/dev0 or COM5

# Python Script
Run this script and wait for the console to print the messages from the STM 32 board.

# Why?
This project was created to transmit sensor data from a microcontroller of high performance(STM) to a simple programming language as Python to then use ROS for robotic applications.
